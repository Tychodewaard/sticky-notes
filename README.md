# sticky-notes
Sticky notes module for DNN (formerly DotNetNuke)

This module is great for events or project kick-offs.
It facilitates ideation, prioritizing and voting by sticky notes.

We use it to extend the experience of events or to give everyone in a project team a 'voice'.
Stages:
1. All users can create sticky notes
2. Creation is turned off (settings) and voting (up or down) is enabled.
3. Prioritizing can be turned on so admins (for example) can rearrange and select all ideas that have scored the most points.
